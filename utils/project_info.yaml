  One of the principles behind NatKet.com is accessibility of data.
  We wish to share the data with anyone who wants to build cool
  video game oriented websites, apps and services.

  This means that you are not only contributing to the value of NatKet
  but to thousands of other projects as well. We are looking forward
  to see what exciting game related projects you come up with. Happy coding!

  For a high level overview of our juicy data,

  # OpenAPI Specification
  This API is documented in **OpenAPI format** and is based on
  [Petstore sample](http://petstore.swagger.io/) provided by [swagger.io](http://swagger.io) team.
  It was **extended** to illustrate features of [generator-openapi-repo](https://github.com/Rebilly/generator-openapi-repo)
  tool and [ReDoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) documentation. In addition to standard
  OpenAPI syntax we use a few [vendor extensions](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc/blob/main/docs/redoc-vendor-extensions.md).

  # Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
  This API features Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) implemented in compliance with  [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/).
  And that allows cross-domain communication from the browser.
  All responses have a wildcard same-origin which makes them completely public and accessible to everyone, including any code on any site.

  # Authentication

  Petstore offers two forms of authentication:
    - API Key
    - OAuth2
  OAuth2 - an open protocol to allow secure authorization in a simple
  and standard method from web, mobile and desktop applications.
